D for Komodo
============

What is it?
-----------

This project aims to add support for the [D programming language](http://dlang.org/) to [Komodo IDE](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide/) and [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/komodo-edit/).

Currently, only basic syntax highlighting is supported.  Syntax checking and code intelligence are planned for the future.
